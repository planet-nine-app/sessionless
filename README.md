## Sessionless

*Sessionless* is an attempt to make authentication handling easier for developers and users, while also enabling interesting behavior not possible with traditional sessions.
No emails, no passwords, and no sessions, just establish auth and get going.

Sessionless is an authentication protocol, which can also be referred to as the SessionLess Authentication Protocol (SLAP).

[Here is a simple video of what Sessionless can do.]

With Sessionless, and any subesequent open source projects I start, I'm trying to make them accessible to all parts of the tech industry. 
Right now that means focusing on dev, UX, and product, but qa, analytics, customer success, etc. are all welcome.
Trust me, there's plenty of work to go around.

To this end, I'm going to try my best to provide domain-specific documentation as an entry point. 
This is very much a wip, and, as far as I know, not something that there's an established pattern for so all feedback welcome.

| Dev          | UX          | Product     |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| [README-DEV] | [README-UX] | coming soon |

[README-DEV]: ./README-DEV.md
[README-UX]: ./README-UX.md
